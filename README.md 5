Name of the Experiment:

Implementation of Conditional Statements using if-else and switch-case in C++


 Tools Used:

IDE: Code::Blocks / Dev-C++ / Turbo C++ / Visual Studio Code

Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

Language: C++



 Theory:

Conditional statements in C++ are used to make decisions based on conditions. These statements control the flow of a program based on certain criteria.

1. if-else Statement:

Used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true; otherwise, another block of code is executed.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
    // code block if condition is true
} else {
    // code block if condition is false
}



2. switch-case Statement:

Used to execute one block of code among many based on the value of a variable.

Syntax:

switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // code block
        break;
    case value2:
        // code block
        break;
    default:
        // default code block
}

Conclusion:

The if-else statement is useful for range-based conditions or when comparing variable values.

The switch-case statement is ideal for discrete fixed values like menu options or predefined cases.

Conditional statements enhance decision-making capabilities in programs and are fundamental to programming logic.
