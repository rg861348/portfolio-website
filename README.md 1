Hello World and Calculator â€“ C++ Program


Aim:

To display the classic "Hello World" message and create a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers entered by the user

Apparatus:

GNU g++ Compiler (for compiling C++ code locally)

Code Editor (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks) or an Online C++ Compiler (e.g., GeeksforGeeks IDE, Replit)



Important Note:

This program is meant for beginners. It does not include error handling for invalid operations like division by zero. To make the calculator more robust, if-else conditions should be added in the division section to prevent division when the denominator is zero.



Program Explanation:

1. Header Inclusion:

#include <iostream>

This header allows the use of standard input (cin) and output (cout) functions.

2. Namespace Usage:

using namespace std;

This line lets us use cin and cout directly without writing std:: each time.

3. Program Execution Begins:

The function int main() is the entry point of the program.

It starts by printing:

cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming!" << endl;
cout << "Hello World" << endl;

4. User Input Example:

Declares a variable and accepts input from the user:

int a;
cout << "Enter a number: ";
cin >> a;

Displays the entered number and a thank you message:

cout << "You entered: " << a << endl;
cout << "Thank you for your input." << endl;

5. Program Completion:

return 0;

This signals the successful end of the program.


About iostream and std:

iostream is the standard input/output stream library in C++.

Objects like cin and cout belong to the std (standard) namespace.

You can either:

Use std::cout and std::cin explicitly, or

Use using namespace std; once to omit the std:: prefix throughout the program.


About the Calculator Section:

1. Variable Declaration:

The calculator uses:

float a, b, sum, sub, mul, div;

where a and b store user inputs, and the others store arithmetic results.



2. Input from User:

cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
cin >> a >> b;


3. Operations Performed:

sum = a + b;
sub = a - b;
mul = a * b;
div = a / b;


4. Display Results:

cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
cout << "Difference: " << sub << endl;
cout << "Product: " << mul << endl;
cout << "Quotient: " << div << endl;


Conclusion:

This beginner-level C++ program demonstrates:

Basic syntax and structure of a C++ program

Input and output using cin and cout

Variable declarations and arithmetic operations

The foundation for writing more complex programs in the future


It is a useful stepping stone for anyone just starting with C++ programming.
