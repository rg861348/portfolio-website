Name of the Experiment:
Conditional Statements and Looping Constructs in C++

Tools Used:

Language: C++

IDE: Turbo C++ / Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code

Compiler: g++ (MinGW or GCC)



Theory:

Conditional and looping statements allow programmers to control the flow of execution in a C++ program.

Conditional Statements (if, else, switch) are used to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions.

Looping Statements (for, while, do-while) repeat blocks of code as long as a condition is true.


These constructs are foundational in programming to handle repetitive tasks and decision-making efficiently.

Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates how conditional and looping statements in C++ are essential for decision-making and repetition. Through examples like printing patterns, authenticating passwords, and using different loops, we learned how control structures help in writing efficient, real-world applications.
