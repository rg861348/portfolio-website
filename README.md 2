Title of the Experiment

To study and implement C++ program structure using various data types.


 Tools Used

Language: C++

Compiler: GCC / MinGW / Turbo C++

IDE: Code::Blocks / Dev C++ / Visual Studio Code

Operating System: Windows / Linux


Theory

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. The structure of a basic C++ program includes the following components:

Preprocessor directives (e.g., #include<iostream>)

Namespace declaration (using namespace std;)

Main function where execution begins

Variable declarations with appropriate data types


Data Types in C++

Data types specify the type of data a variable can store. The main data types in C++ are:

int – Integer values (e.g., 10, -3)

float – Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14)

double – Double-precision floating-point numbers

char – Single character (e.g., 'A')

bool – Boolean values (true or false)


Each data type has a different size in memory and is used for specific types of operations. Understanding these is fundamental to efficient memory usage and logical programming.

 Conclusion

This experiment provided hands-on experience with the basic structure of a C++ program and the usage of different data types. It helped reinforce:

How to declare and initialize variables

How to display variable values using cout

Understanding memory size of each data type using sizeof()


This foundational knowledge is essential for writing more complex and efficient C++ programs in future experiments.
