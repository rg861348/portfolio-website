Name of the Experiment:

Operations with Operators Programs in C++




 Tools Used:

Programming Language: C++

Compiler: GCC / g++

IDE/Platform: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code / OnlineGDB or any C++ supported environment

Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS



 Theory:

In C++, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. The if, else if, and else statements allow decision-making based on conditions.

This experiment demonstrates how to:

1. Identify whether a number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional checks.


2. Determine the quadrant of a point (x, y) based on the signs of x and y values:

I Quadrant: x > 0, y > 0

II Quadrant: x < 0, y > 0

III Quadrant: x < 0, y < 0

IV Quadrant: x > 0, y < 0

Axis/Origin: x or y is zero



3. Use conditional logic to assign grades based on marks entered:

A+ (≥90), A (80–89), B+ (70–79), B (60–69), C (50–59), D (40–49), F (<40)




The goal is to practice decision control structures and apply logical reasoning using basic operators in C++.


Conclusion:

Through this experiment, we have successfully:

Implemented multiple decision-making programs using conditional statements in C++

Practiced the use of relational and logical operators

Strengthened understanding of control flow in programs

Learned how to write real-world logic such as grading systems and coordinate analysis


These foundational concepts are essential for developing more complex logic and algorithms in C++.
